What one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months. (Fred Brooks)
A primary cause of complexity is that software vendors uncritically adopt almost any feature that users want. (Niklaus Wirth)
If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. (Edsger Dijkstra)
Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. (Brian W. Kernighan)
C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do, it blows away your whole leg. (Bjarne Stroustrup)
Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter. (Eric S. Raymond)
One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code. (Ken Thompson)
The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit. (Anonymous)
Learning to code is useful no matter what your career ambitions are. (Arianna Huffington)
It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission. (Grace Hopper)
I had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They carefully told me, computers could only do arithmetic; they could not do programs. (Grace Hopper)
We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraical patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves. (Ada Lovelace)
The science of operations, as derived from mathematics more especially, is a science of itself, and has its own abstract truth and value. (Ada Lovelace)
Talk is cheap. Show me the code. (Linus Torvalds)
